bugs :c
	//after adding a new bit, the model appears to refresh itself, generating a brand new ng-repeat. this kicks the users' focus from the bit.
	after a certain amount of time has passed, the app will log the user in, but the credentials will not be valid for the session. this appears to be random as of yet.

		list / grid in one half
		note in other?

	killing bits animation
	ng cloak / whatever before user is logged in after reload
