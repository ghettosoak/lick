		<p class="copy">LICK is a super simple, distributed note taking (web)app, inspired by the flexibility of text editors like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Sublime Text</a>. It is the spiritual successor to <a href="http://tra.ject.ch" target="_blank" class="link">Tra.ject</a>.</p>
		<p class="copy">It is set entirely in Matt McInerney’s <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway" target="blank" class="link">Raleway Light</a>.</p>
		<p class="copy">It is built with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Angular.js</a> and <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Firebase</a>, powering the front and back ends; with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/" target="_blank" class="link">AngularFire</a> linking the two.</p>
		<p class="copy">It uses Wes Cruver’s <a href="https://github.com/chieffancypants/angular-hotkeys" target="_blank" class="link">Angular adaptation</a> of Craig Campbell’s <a href="https://craig.is/killing/mice" target="_blank" class="link">Mousetrap</a> to delegate the myriad of keyboard shortcuts. It also uses the Angular UI <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable" target="_blank" class="link">sortable directive</a> where applicable.</p>
		<p class="copy">It uses Manifest Web Design’s <a href="https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster" target="_blank" class="link">Angular adaptation</a> of Ducksboard’s <a href="http://gridster.net/" target="_blank" class="link">Gridster</a> to make the boards lovely.</p>
		<p class="copy">This time, it’s not the product of creative frustration; but rather just something I’ve wanted to build for a while. It was made in many cafés and trains across America's Midwest; as well as in Bern, Switzerland.</p>
		<p class="copy">LICK uses cookies to keep you logged into the app as much as possible. It does not track you. It will never try to sell you anything you don't want. It will never show you adverts. It does not read your secrets. Noone does – not here, anyways.</p>
		<p class="copy">While <a href="http://ject.ch" class="link">internally</a> it's at v3.0.0, it is still very much a work in progress. Get in touch with me <a href="mailto:e@ject.ch" class="link">here</a>.</p>
